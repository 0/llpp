MuPDF[1] rendering library is used to do the actual work, so it needs
to be built and installed to use llpp.

Note that MuPDF is a moving target therefore below is the commit id
of the git version of MuPDF that this version of llpp is known to work
with:
61de1fe7e510fdd425686c478439209f6f7a4b73

llpp also depends on OCaml[2] (version 4.02.x), LablGL[3] having a C
compiler wouldn't hurt either.
         * MuPDF depends on libcrypto[4] part of openssl
         * Building LablGL from sources requires camlp4[5]
