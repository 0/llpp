Prerequisites for building from sources:
        bash          [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)]
        mupdf         [http://mupdf.com/]
        opengl        [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL]
        git           [https://git-scm.com/]
        ocaml (4.07+) [http://ocaml.org/]
           If not present will be downloaded from the network and
           built/used locally without system-wide installation.

  To obtain and build version of mupdf that llpp is known to work with
     llpp% bash misc/getmupdf.bash
     (Caveat emptor: this will clone the entire mupdf)

  llpp% bash build.bash build

Standalone binary should now be in build/llpp.

Native macOS
------------
  If `bash build.bash build' succeeds, standalone macOS app should
  be in build/llpp.app.
