MuPDF[1] rendering library is used to do the actual work, so it needs
to be built and installed to use llpp, MuPDF's README[2] describes how
to build it and lists its dependencies.

Note that MuPDF is a moving target therefore below is the commit id
of the git version of MuPDF that this version of llpp is known to work
with:
d396b126c7ab5c241e0dc7ff0edd9942ad5dfdaa

llpp also depends on OCaml[3], lablGL[4], having a C compiler wouldn't
hurt either.

To build llpp one can invoke `sh buildall.sh' which will first attempt
to automatically fetch lablGL, mupdf, mupdf's prerequisites and build
them, then, if everything goes fine, it will proceed building llpp
itself. Note that OCaml still needs to be installed separately, also,
in addition to the usual suspects (i.e.  GCC, make, binutils, OCaml),
you will need `wget' and `unzip' for this script to work.

If everything goes fine llpp binary will appear, it can be used like so:

$ ./llpp /path/to/some.pdf
or
$ ./llpp -p password /path/to/some.password.protected.pdf
