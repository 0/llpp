MuPDF[1] rendering library is used to do the actual work, so it needs
to be built and installed to use llpp, MuPDF's README[2] describes how
to build it and lists its dependencies. Snapshots of MuPDF itself can
be found here[3]

Note that MuPDF is a moving target therefore bellow is the commit id
of the git version of MuPDF that this version of llpp is known to work
with:
ac84904af638b243284e24d5f401c3f1a21cb0ef

llpp also depends on OCaml[4], lablGL[5], having a C compiler wouldn't
hurt either.

To build llpp one can invoke `sh buildall.sh' which will first attempt
to automatically fetch lablGL, mupdf, mupdf's prerequisites and build
them, then, if everything goes fine, it will proceed building llpp
itself. Note that OCaml still needs to be installed separately, also,
in addition to the usual suspects (i.e.  GCC, make, binutils, OCaml),
you will need `wget' and `unzip' for this script to work.

If everything goes fine llpp binary will appear, it can be used like so:

$ ./llpp /path/to/some.pdf
or
$ ./llpp -p password /path/to/some.password.protected.pdf
