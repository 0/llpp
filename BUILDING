At the time of this writing[1] vanilla MuPDF[2] does not work (text
spans are somewhat fucked up), the (patched) version from
SumatraPDF[3]'s SVN repository[4] however works nicely (SumatraPDF's
SVN repository also contains all the other prerequisites (such as
openjpeg, jbig2dec, etc))

llpp also depends on OCaml[5] and lablGL[6], having a C compiler
wouldn't hurt either.

To build llpp, provided that all prereqs are already built, one should
invoke `sh build.sh' from the top of llpp's directory, prior to that it's
advisable to review build.sh so that it matches local mupdf installation
(or lack thereof)

If everything goes fine llpp binary will appear, it can be used like so:

$ ./llpp /path/to/some.pdf
