MuPDF[1] rendering library is used to do the actual work, so it needs
to be built and installed to use llpp, MuPDF's README[2] describes how
to build it and lists its dependencies. Snapshots of MuPDF itself can
be found here[3], dependencies here[4]

It should be noted that vanilla MuPDF does not handle internal links
precisely, one can use patched MuPDF from SumatraPDF[5], but MuPDF
from SumatraPDF has problems of it's own (wrong font substitutions),
user is free to pick his poison.

llpp also depends on OCaml[6] and lablGL[7], having a C compiler
wouldn't hurt either.

To build llpp "the easy way" one can invoke `sh buildall.sh' which
will first attempt to automatically fetch openjpeg, jbig2dec, mupdf
and build them then, if everything goes fine it will proceed building
llpp itself. Note that OCaml should still be installed separately.

Otherwise, provided that all prereqs are already built, one should
invoke `sh build.sh' from the top of llpp's directory, prior to that
it's advisable to review build.sh so that it matches local mupdf
installation (or lack thereof)

If everything goes fine llpp binary will appear, it can be used like so:

$ ./llpp /path/to/some.pdf
