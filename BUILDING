At the time of this writing[1] vanilla MuPDF[2] does not work (text
spans are somewhat fucked up), the (patched) version from
SumatraPDF[3]'s SVN repository[4] however works nicely (SumatraPDF's
SVN repository also contains all the other prerequisites (such as
openjpeg, jbig2dec, etc)

llpp also depends on OCaml[5] and lablGL[6], having a C compiler
wouldn't hurt either.

To build llpp, provided that all prereqs are already built, one should
invoke `sh build.sh' from the top of llpp's directory.

If everything goes fine llpp binary will appear, it can be used like so:

$ ./llpp /path/to/some.pdf
