Looks like it's possible to make "progressive zoom" "nicer" by taking
already rendered tiles from the cache and scale them via GL in place
of not-yet-fully-rendered(by mupdf) ones, thus avoiding place holders
and providing more visually pleasant experience.

There was some proof of concept code to do that, but the
implementation got lost, then build system took precedence, and
finally - "writers block".
