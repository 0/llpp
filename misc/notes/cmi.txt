On why wsi.mli is symlinked from the root to wsi/_platform_/wsi.mli

    #!/bin/sh
    set -eu

    mkdir -p /tmp/cmi/{d,b/d}
    cd /tmp/cmi
    touch a.mli d/a.ml
    ocamlc -c -I b/ -o b/a.cmi a.mli
    ocamlc -c -I b/ -o b/d/a.cmo d/a.ml

after running the above script a.cmi will be in b/ and in b/d
