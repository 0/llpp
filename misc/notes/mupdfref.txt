mupdf git repository is enormous. mostly due to submodules and
attempts to use shallow clones of those were unsuccessful, so if one
has an existing mupdf checkout bandwidth can be saved by doing a clone
with a reference like so:

$ cloneargs="--reference $X/git/mupdf' sh misc/getmupdf.sh build/mupdf
