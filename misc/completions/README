Shell completion
================

This directory contains files for enabling tab completion in user shells.

  Makefile
  mkcomp.sh    Script which generates completion files from the following:
  llpp.in      Config file with file extensions for llpp
  llppac.in    Config file with file extensions for llppac
  */*.mk       Shell completion templates

Building
--------

Run `make` to generate bash and zsh completions for llpp and llppac from
`llpp.in`, `llppac.in`, and the templates in `bash/` and `zsh/`.

Installation
------------

Bash
~~~~

Install the completions into wherever the `bash-completion` package's
completions are stored, typically in `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`.

Zsh
~~~

Install the completions to a directory in zsh's `$fpath`.  Packages generally
put their zsh completions in the directory `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/`.
