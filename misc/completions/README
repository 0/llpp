Shell completion
================

This directory contains files for enabling tab completion in user shells.
Instruction for some shells follows:

Bash
----

If you have `bash-completion` installed, you can install `llpp` in the `bash/`
directory into wherever that package's completions are stored, typically in
`/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`.  Alternatively, you can just copy
the contents into or source it in your `~/.bashrc`.

Zsh
---

To enable completion for `llpp`, install `_llpp` to a directory in zsh's
`$fpath`.  Packages generally put their zsh completions in the directory
`/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/`.  Alternatively, for the same effect, one can
add something like:

  compdef "_files -g '*.(pdf|xps|zip|cbz|jpg|png)'" llpp

to `.zshrc`.
