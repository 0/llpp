[1] i'm somewhat mouse button confused, since i use "left handed" mouse
    while not being lefthanded

[2] text selection requires xsel
    http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/
    On OSX and Windows selected text will be dumped to the terminal
    Also selection can not cross page boundaries

[3] if the document was previously visited initial backspace will
    jump to the last visited place
