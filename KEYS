[1] i'm somewhat mouse button confused, since i use "left handed" mouse
    while not being lefthanded

[2] text selection requires
    xsel on X11         - http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/
    wsel under Windows  - http://repo.or.cz/w/llpp.git/blob/master:/wsel.c
    pbcopy under OSX    - ships with the system

[3] if the document was previously visited initial backspace will
    jump to the last visited place

======================================================================
Caveat emptor:

o Selection can not cross page boundaries
o Text searching is very naive
