* TODO Fixme
** TODO linknav + presentation (link might not fit the visible area)
   fullscreening while loading complex documents has visual quirks
* TODO outline for cbz
  file names? exif?

** TODO Parallel builds
** TODO Removing .mlis leads to build errors
   Nuking everything (or just deleting .deps?) solves it though
** DONE errors in config.ml (!)

   they do not lead to aborted compilation
*** recipe: making a fresh error and compiling
    (so that both config.ml and stuff that depends on it is being rebuilt by build.bash)
* TODO [maybe] inside rect/quad (_Generic)
* TODO Shift-insert for searches
* TODO Threaded rendering
  Scrolling documents with pgdown on a 3840x2160 monitor utilizing
  just 2 threads (event loop, display/mupdf rendering) is not fast
  enough.
* TODO wikit - https://github.com/moosotc/llpp/issues/128

  wsi translates codes to syms plug config int it
* DONE fix build system

  failure scenario:
  at the end of the utils add:
    let u = ();;
  rebuild
  change u to
    let u = fail;;
  build would not stop at the first compilation failure

  issue is manifold:
    a) die doesn't really
    b) especially in bocaml where subshell was used ("(" instead of "{")
       why? i don't remember :(
* DONE font scaling factor on X11
  CLOSED: [2020-10-27 Tue 10:43]
  Current font sizes were (last) hard coded on a 2560x1440
* TODO figure out why "err" ends up in the fd 2
  when omitting diag callbacks
  (in one case it was first 3 characters of a much longer (jbig related
   message that began with error ...)
* TODO err/warn in C code when standard error was redirected
  workaround in place
