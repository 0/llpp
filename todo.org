  failure scenario:
  at the end of the utils add:
    let u = ();;
  rebuild
  change u to
    let u = fail;;
  build would not stop at the first compilation failure

  issue is manifold:
    a) die doesn't really
    b) especially in bocaml where subshell was used ("(" instead of "{")
       why? i don't remember :(
* TODO [maybe] inside rect/quad (_Generic)
* TODO Shift-insert for searches
* TODO Threaded rendering
  Scrolling documents with pgdown on a 3840x2160 monitor utilizing
  just 2 threads (event loop, display/mupdf rendering) is not fast
  enough.
* TODO wikit - https://github.com/moosotc/llpp/issues/128
